# Workflow Execution

End-to-end sequence for a task-style workflow: from CLI submission, through
DAG planning and stage-level scheduling, to per-step gRPC dispatch. This is
the v0.1 surface; v0.2 layered cost accounting and budget enforcement onto
the same path (highlighted below).

```

## Step output templating

Downstream steps reference upstream outputs with Jinja2-like syntax:

```yaml
steps:
  - id: research
    agent: researcher
    input: { topic: "{{ workflow.inputs.topic }}" }
  - id: draft
    agent: writer
    depends_on: [research]
    input: { context: "{{ steps.research.output }}" }
```

The planner resolves these references at stage-entry time, after all
`depends_on` steps in earlier stages have produced output.

## Retry semantics

Retry **policy** lives inside the `Executor` — it owns the backoff loop for
transient gRPC and LLM errors and only surfaces failure to the `Scheduler`
once the attempts are exhausted ([internal/executor/executor.go:369](../../internal/executor/executor.go#L369)
sets `result.RetryCount = attempt`). The `Scheduler` still consumes that count
when it folds step results into cost metadata and span attributes
([internal/scheduler/stage_runner.go:192](../../internal/scheduler/stage_runner.go#L192),
[internal/scheduler/budget.go:236](../../internal/scheduler/budget.go#L236)) —
so the retry is invisible to scheduling, but the *outcome* is not.

## What v0.2 added on this path

- `internal/cost/` — tokens/USD/cache-hit accounting and response cache.
- Per-step metadata: `EstimatedCostUSD`, `TokensUsed`, `LLMCallCount`,
  `RetryCount`, `CacheHit`, `WallTimeMs`.
- Pre-stage budget checks in `internal/scheduler/budget.go`. Exceeding
  `max_tokens` or `max_llm_calls` aborts the run with a structured error.
- `GET /api/v1/cost/summary` endpoint for post-hoc inspection.

Cost tracking is orthogonal to the persona runtime — persona agents hit the
same cost tracker when they call `LLMClient.complete()`. See
[persona-runtime.md](persona-runtime.md) for the autonomous/event-driven flow.
